 ## To run simple clone and run on android studio or intelliJ with android support
 
 * For networking KTOR CLIENT for android was used because of it's out of the box support for coroutines
 
 * For Dependency Injection KOIN was used for it's simplicity 
 
 * The Architecture used was MVVM modelled in clean architecture format.  Multiple modules was not implemented to save development time, but this structure is transferrable to a multiple module structure.
